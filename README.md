# Leito Minesweeper App

The first time the demo is opened is a bit slow. Heroku dynos are sleeping ;)

-   [Heroku live demo](https://leito-minesweeper-client.herokuapp.com/)
-   [Swagger API documentation](https://leito-minesweeper-api.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html)
-   [My own NPM rest-client library for this test :)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leito-mineswipper-rest-client)

## Documentation

-   [API](api)
-   [API Rest client](rest-client)
-   [Client](client/client)

Note: The intermediate `client` folder is the express app to deploy react app in heroku
